# Reducers

Reducers are located within `src/reducers`. Each file `default`ly exports its reducer:

```
src/reducers/
└── my-reducer
    ├── README.md     // Documentation for the reducer
    ├── test.js       // Tests for the reducer
    └── index.js      // The reducer itself
```

In some cases, such as the `sessionToken` reducer, we're using reducer enhancers. Reducer enhancers
are a great way to allow a reducer to "sync" with another resource (in the case of `sessionToken`,
we use the `localstorage-reducer-enhancer` helper to duplicate data in `localStorage`). While the side effects associated with enhancers are cleanly separated from the reducer code, use them sparingly (such as all things that create side effects).

There are a few main types of reducers in this project.

## Collection reducers
Collections are a central data storage concept in this project. Essentially, they are a way of
storing an array of objects in a consistent fashion, and include baked in ways of doing common
things, such as a loading interval, filters, paging, etc.

A few examples of this reducer type include `spaces`, `links`, `tokens` and `doorways`.

## General structure
A collection has two parts - the actions and the reducer.

Each collection reducer has a common structure:
```json
{
  "filters": {
    "filterOne": "value"
  },
  "data": [],
  "loading": true
}
```

This structure not only makes it easy to predict where data will be found but also provides a
structure that is easy to expand upon as new features must be implemented.

## Auto-conversion of data from snake_case to camelCase in reducers
Most of our backend services at Density return data in snake case (lowercase and
underscore-separated). While it's perfectly valid to work with data in the format within the
frontend code, it doesn't match with the typical javascript conventions of camelcase variable names.
Therefore, each collection pipes its data through the helper called object-snake-to-camel, which
does this conversion for us. In other projects, the concept of a mapper, serializer, or marshaller
exists, used to convert data coming into and out of the system into a appropriate representations. At least in this project, reducer-specific mappers haven't been
required *yet*, and relying on `object-snake-to-camel` has been sufficient for now.
